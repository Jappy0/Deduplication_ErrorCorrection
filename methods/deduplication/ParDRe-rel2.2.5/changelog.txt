- Versions higher than 1.1.5 solve a problem with the FASTA input files
- Versions higher than 1.2.5 solve a problem with the accuracy of the paired analyses
- Version 1.3.5 and posterior include the following improvements:
  a) The user can specify the output file names
  b) When two reads in fastq format are collapsed, now the choice of which sequence is kept is not random, the one with the highest average quality is chosen.
  c) Removed the option to discard bases with low quality
- Version 2.0.5 and posterior include the following improvements:
  a) The user can discard only optical duplicates (-d option)
  b) Support for compressed input/output with -gz extension (-z option)
- Version 2.1.5 optimizes the removal of only optical duplicates by ordering in the clusters by the X coordinate
- Version 2.2.5 solves several bugs:
